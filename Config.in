	  Application build for the chosen CPU platform.  This only

	  This is typically suitable for container images (LXC), but can
	  also be useful for systems where a pre-built kernel exists
	  already.

	  Selecting this pre-selects the app profile option (below),
	  this is only a recommendation.

config NETBOX_TYPE_OS

	help
	  Complete operating system, including kernel and userland,
	  for the chosen CPU platform.

	  This is the same as the application build, but includes a

	  NetBox is built around BusyBox and Finit.  Comprising the very
	  core of the exprience of this embedded system.  On top of that
	  two main profiles are available; slimmed down applications or
	  full-blown operating systems.

	    o Applicaiton        Finit + Dropbear SSH + tcpdump
	    o Operating System   Finit + lots of tools & daemons
	    o Custom             Finit

	  See each profile for details.

config NETBOX_PROFILE_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom (minimal)"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT
	help
	  The custom profile allows more fine grained control over what
	  packages are included.  However, NetBox always has Finit as
	  its preferred init.  If you want something else, you should
	  probably skip NetBox and use buildroot directly.

config NETBOX_PROFILE_APP
	bool "Appplication (basic)"
	help
	  The application profile includes a set of basic packages
	  that usually are essential to a basic contatainer app:

	    o Dropbear SSH (server + client)
	    o tcpdump

	  SSH in to your container from remote, and support to debug
	  network connections in case SSH connection fails.

	  If you want to create a really small app and do not need these
	  tools, use the custom profile or use buildroot directly.

config NETBOX_PROFILE_OS
	bool "Operating System (full)"
	help
	  The operating system profile comes with a lot more features
	  compared to the other profiles.  The intention is to provide
	  common network services and also tools for debugging network
	  devices on all the different layers in the stack of a switch
	  or router product.

	  This profile will likely expand and change a lot over time.
	  Use the custom profile to get more fine grained control.

	  Build an FIT image with all device trees in boot/, creating a
	  configuration for each, the default kernel and the SquashFS as

	  This is useful for testing NetBox on systems which do not have
	  a bootloader capable of loading standard images, e.g. U-Boot
	  on various evaluation/development boards.
